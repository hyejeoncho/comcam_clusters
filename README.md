Notebooks for the analysis of galaxy clusters in ComCam data


`ComCam_StarterKit` - Tutorial notebook on loading ComCam data with Butler. Loads the relevant coadds and catalogs for Abell 360, displays a `gri` image along with a red-sequence plot. 

`ACO360_WL_HSMcalib_CLMM` - First attempt at getting a shear profile around the Abell 360 cluster from ComCam data, using color cut source selection, HSC calibration, and CLMM for the shear profile measurement. Main steps are there but a lot remain to be checked/improved.
